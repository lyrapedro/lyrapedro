Hello, my name is Pedro!

I am a Computer Science student and I have been working as a developer for 4 years. I started with Python frameworks (Flask and Django), and I found myself as a .NET developer, working for 3 years with this technology. I'm also specializing in React Native, and I dream of becoming a reference on this stack! (.Net + React Native)

Welcome to my profile and feel free!
