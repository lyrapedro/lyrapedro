Hello, my name is Pedro!
I am a Computer Science student and I have been working as a developer for 4 years. I started with Python frameworks (Flask and Django), and I found myself as a .NET developer, working for 5 years with this technology. This year, I started my journey chasing my dream of becoming a game developer. I know it will be a long road to go, but I am focused, and until then I will continue working as a .NET developer.

Welcome to my profile and feel free!
